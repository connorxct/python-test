Specifically, the maximum radiation one of these individuals can tolerate is normally distributed with a mean of 10 grays and a standard deviation of 1.25 grays. The radiation level on the ground, however, is 8 grays. Compute the minimum number of radiation-proof suits they will need to fully accommodate the individuals who cannot tolerate the radiation on the ground."
